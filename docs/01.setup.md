### Environment Setup

For this project, Yarn berry is used as the package manager. To setup Yarn berry do the following:

1. Ensure you have NodeJS version 16 or higher installed

```bash
node -v # should return the version of node installed
```

2. Corepack is a NodeJS cli tool that helps install package managers. Use it to install yarn

```bash
corepack enable # enables the corepack tool if it's not enabled
corepack prepare --all # installs the package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
```
